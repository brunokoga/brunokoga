Hi! My name is Bruno 👋! I'm an iOS Developer/Tech Lead/Engineering Manager at [Doctolib](https://about.doctolib.com) ([Siilo app](https://www.siilo.com)).

I started working with iOS development during my internship in 2010 and never stoped. I often say that making iOS apps is the only thing that I know how to do professionaly. And I'm only half-joking 🙃.

If you want to know more about me, I suggest visiting the websites below:
