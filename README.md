Hi there ðŸ‘‹!

My name is Bruno. I'm an iOS Developer/Tech Lead/Engineering Manager at Doctolib.
I started working with iOS development at my internship during my last year of university in 2010 and never stoped. I often say that making iOS apps is the only thing that I know how to do professionaly. And I'm only half-joking ðŸ™ƒ.

If you want to know more about me, I suggest visiting the websites below:
